<h1 align="center">NEPAL:THE LAND OF MOUNT EVEREST</h1>


<p align="center">Nepal, country of Asia, lying along the southern slopes of the Himalayan mountain ranges.
It is a landlocked country located between India to the east, south, and west and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north.
Its territory extends roughly 500 miles (800 kilometres) from east to west and 90 to 150 miles from north to south. The capital is Kathmandu.
Nepal, long under the rule of hereditary prime ministers favouring a policy of isolation, remained closed to the outside world until a palace revolt in 1950 restored the crown’s authority in 1951; the country gained admission to the United Nations in 1955. 
In 1991 the kingdom established a multiparty parliamentary system. In 2008, however, after a decadelong period of violence and turbulent negotiation with a strong Maoist insurgency, the monarchy was dissolved, and Nepal was declared a democratic republic.

Wedged between two giants, India and China, Nepal seeks to keep a balance between the two countries in its foreign policy—and thus to remain independent. 
A factor that contributes immensely to the geopolitical importance of the country is the fact that a strong Nepal can deny China access to the rich Gangetic Plain; Nepal thus marks the southern boundary of the Chinese sphere north of the Himalayas in Asia.

There are at least 92 living languages spoken in Nepal, though some studies list 123. Nepal's languages come from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and indigenous.

It is the first language of about half the country's population, and is used by people of most ethnic groups to communicate with each other.</p>


<p>Both Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal date back more than 2000 years. The 2001 census recorded that 80.6% of the population was Hindu. Buddhism was practiced by about 11% of the population, although many people often practice their own mix of Hindu, Buddhist, and/or animist traditions. About 3.2% practice Islam. Another 3.6% of the population follows the native Kirant religion. Christianity is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.</p>


<p>Nepalese people have several festivals that they celebrate each year. The longest and the most important of these is Dashain. It is celebrated for 15 days, and is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga. Most festivals include dancing and music, as well as all kinds of local food.</p>
